# Sarcasm-Detection-In-Tweets
An Information Retrieval Project "Sarcasm_Detection_Using-Sentiment-Analysis"

Sarcasm is a form of communication that is intended to mock or harass someone by using words with the opposite of their literal meaning. However, identification of sarcasm is somewhat difficult due to the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Recognition of sarcasm is a task that can potentially provide a lot of benefits to other areas of natural language processing. In this research, we propose a new method to identify sarcasm in tweets that focuses on several approaches:
1) sentiment analysis, 
2) concept level and common-sense knowledge,
3) coherence and
4) machine learning classification.
We used support vector machine (SVM) to classify sarcastic tweet based on our proposed features as well as ordinary N-grams. Our proposed classifier is an ensemble of two SVMs with two different feature sets. The results of the experiment show our method outperforms the baseline method and achieves 60% accuracy.
